# Question 1: (10 marks) 
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a # multiple of 5, between 1000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.




# Question 2:(10 marks)
# With a given integral number n,write a program to generate a dictionary that contains 
# (i, i*i) such that it contains integral numbers between 1 and n (both included).
# Then the program should print the dictionary.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}



# Question 3:(10 marks)
# Factorials are just products of numbers. e.g the factorial of 4 is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4.
# Factorial of n is 1 x 2 x 3 x ...... x n.
# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# 40320 



# Question 4: (10 marks)
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints 
# the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world
#
# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world
#



# Question 5:(10 marks)
# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and 
# prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 
# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
#
# Then, the output should be:
#
# again and hello makes perfect practice world




# Question 6:(25 marks)
# Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output # should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
# 
# Then, the output should be:
# 2:2
# 3.:1
# 3?:1
# New:1
# Python:5
# Read:1
# and:1
# between:1
# choosing:1
# or:2
# to:1
#
#
#



# Question 7:(25 marks)
# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case 
# letters and lower case letters.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# Hello world!
# Then, the output should be:
# UPPER CASE 1
# LOWER CASE 9
